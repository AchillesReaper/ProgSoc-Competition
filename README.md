1 Hello World
--
Welcome to the programming competition! We assume that this is the first programming competition for many contestants here, so we’re starting off with a basic Hello World question.

You need to read a number from standard input (stdin) and print hello world that number of times.

Input
A single number (1 <= N < 1000), representing the number of times hello world should be printed.

Output
Print Hello World N times.

Sample “1”
1
Hello World

Sample “4”
4
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World


2 Console Frame
--
You’re working on a console user interface with some pretty visualizations of data. Part of the interface involves printing out words in a frame, so that they’re more easily visible.

So for example, if you want to display Hello World in a frame, it will print it as:

*********
* Hello *
* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********
Input
You’re given a string of words, separated by spaces.

Output
Print the words in a frame, with one word on each line.
